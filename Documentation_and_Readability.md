# Documentation and Readability

The documentation and readability of this Snake Game codebase are its most significant weaknesses.  
The project severely lacks both external and internal documentation, making it difficult for any developer other than the original author to understand, modify, or maintain the code.  
The absence of clear guidance forces a new reader to spend excessive time deciphering the code's intent and logic.

## 1. External Documentation (README and Project Overview)

The project's `README.md` file is critically underdeveloped. It contains only a single, repetitive line of description and a basic instruction to run the file in Chrome.  

It completely lacks the following standard and helpful elements:

- A meaningful introduction to the project  
- Screenshots or a GIF demonstrating the game in action  
- A clear list of game features or rules  
- Detailed setup or installation instructions  
- An explanation of the controls (how to play the game)  
- A visual or descriptive guide to the project's file and folder structure  
- Any information about the technologies or libraries used  
- License information or contribution guidelines  

**Impact:**  
This minimal README fails to serve its primary purposes: attracting users and onboarding
